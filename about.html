<i><p> To create an IBM Poem, you must first set your vocabulary, one word for each letter of the alphabet.
<br>Then, you must choose your 3-letter acronym.  The letters from here will dictate your title.  
<br>For example, if you choose "IBM", the word corresponding to "I" will be your first word, "B" the second, and so-on.
<br>Next, the first three lines are created using this process.  The first letter in your title, for example "red", will become 3 words - the first your word in "r", and so-on.
<br>Finally, this process is repeated for the words in your three lines.  Every time a word appears, its font size must grow. </i>
