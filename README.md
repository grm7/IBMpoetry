# Instructions:

- Input your 3-letter acronym
- Press submit to generate the poetry

# How It Works
To create an IBM Poem, you must first set your vocabulary, one word for each letter of the alphabet.<br/>
Then, you must choose your 3-letter acronym. The letters from here will dictate your title.<br/>
For example, if you choose "IBM", the word corresponding to "I" will be your first word, "B" the second, and so-on.<br/>
Next, the first three lines are created using this process. The first letter in your title, for example "red", will become 3 words - the first your word in "r", and so-on.<br/>
Finally, this process is repeated for the words in your three lines. Every time a word appears, its font size must grow.<br/>
